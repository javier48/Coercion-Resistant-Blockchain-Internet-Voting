# Coercion-Resistant-Blockchain-Internet-Voting
A blockchain-based voting system with a coercion-resistant scheme to prevent coercion in internet voting.

Coercion-resistant scheme:
1. Dual Password (real password and fake password),
      This scheme allows voters to create two passwords, a real password and a fake password. The voter can use a real password to cast a real vote. But, if the voter is being coerced, they can use fake password to cast fake vote and the vote will not be counted.
2. VID (vote ID),
      This scheme allows voters or non-voter to check the vote data. The data contains a voter user ID and who the voter vote for. The voter can use VID to convince a coercer that the voter has cast a vote according to a coercer's want.
3. Multiple Vote,
      This scheme allows voters to cast a vote more than once and revise a vote, but the latest vote will be counted and the previous vote will not be counted. By using this scheme, the voter had a chance to revise a vote even though the coercer had a control of the voter's account.
